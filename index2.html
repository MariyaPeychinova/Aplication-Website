            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                I always had trouble with the “What do you want to be when you grow up?” thing. 
                This question was asked of me again and again, as I got older, in various forms. At some point, "What do you want to be when you grow up" went from a cute exercise, to the thing that kept me up at night. 
                In times like this, when I felt intense pressure to find my true purpose and calling, I realised that some are good at many things, and I may have an eclectic career path as I am not afraid to try new skills and continue to learn about new ideas. 
                <br>
                Back in Bulgaria I have 15 years of experience in Customer Services positions. The last six of them I worked on creating and growing my own retail business.
                Since I came in the UK, I changed my occupation and became a nanny. As I like communicating with people and work in a team, I really enjoyed working in partnership with the family and taking responsibility for the safety and development of their children. 
                After I started my own family and became busy with our two children, I quickly realized that I am no longer able to dedicate my time and efforts to another family and I must start looking for new career opportunities.
