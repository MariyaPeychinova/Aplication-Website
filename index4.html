                I don’t believe that there will be someone who will not develop a desire to become a web developer after they have read that quote. 
                I felt attracted by coding the very first day I encountered html. 
                For someone that had always thought that programming is only for geeks, having the power to make the page show something I wanted, made me feel amazing. 
                I was surprised that something that from outside looked so unattractive and difficult, made me experience such a joy. 
                Later, when I started learning Java Script, I was absolutely hooked. 
                Just like when I was trying to understand what is in my husband to be head, so many years ago, now I directed my endeavour towards revealing the secret of problem solving. More challenging it was, more tenacious it made me feel. 
                I remember the frustrating moments when I was getting it wrong and the code failed to work, and the excitement and the flurry that engrossed me whenever I managed to succeed. Before I knew it, I’ve become addicted. 
                I don’t believe I’ll ever stop pursuing that certain ‘high’ I get when I solve a problem or fix a bug.

            I always wanted to have a job that I am passionate about. 
            I think working on interesting projects and solving complex problems without being under pressure and benefiting of the knowledge and experience of my team fellows, is the best job I can imagine.

        <h3>Why Founders and Coders?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            I very much appreciate the fact that FAC prioritises a cohesive cohort of people who will work well together over any strong individual candidates. 
            Great teamwork, where everyone’s strengths complement each other and compensate for individual weaknesses is every organisation’s dream. 
            We all need to become better at doing collaboration and learning together, not just talking about it, if we want to thrive in our lives and careers.
            I would like to assure you that I am extremely excited to be part of a collaborative, peer-led learning environment. The last five months have been…
            I love the United Kingdom, I think it is a great place to live, work and bring up a family. 
            I have chosen to apply for the Founders and Coders Programme, as it is a great opportunity to build up the skills and knowledge required to become a web developer and study in fast-paced and dynamic learning environment. 
            I am dedicated and supportive person, self-motivated and committed to collaborative working, and I believe in the FAC Programme I will find myself in good company.
